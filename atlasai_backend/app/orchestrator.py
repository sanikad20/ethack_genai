"""
Multi-Agent Orchestrator — routes an incoming query to the right agent(s),
merges their outputs, and returns a single response the Flutter client
(and later, the AI Action Engine) can consume.

Day 1: routing is naive (keyword-based) and agents are stubs.
This gets smarter as each agent is built out through the week —
the routing/merge logic itself doesn't need to change shape.

        knowledge_agent is additive, not a last-resort fallback: it's
        the only agent that LLM-synthesizes a real answer (the others
        are retrieval-only by design — see maintenance_agent's
        docstring). A query like "what fixed the vibration issue"
        matches maintenance_agent's keywords ("vibrat") AND wants a
        synthesized answer, not just the raw top-matching chunk — so it
        needs both. Previously knowledge_agent only ran when nothing
        else matched, meaning any maintenance/compliance/incident
        keyword silently skipped synthesis entirely.

        knowledge_capture_agent is the one exception: an actual capture/
        interview request wants that flow specifically, not a synthesized
        answer about something.
