"""
Embeddings — computed locally via sentence-transformers, not over the
network. The model is pre-downloaded into the Docker image at build
time (see Dockerfile), so there is zero network dependency at runtime.

This replaces the earlier HF Inference API approach, which was prone
to intermittent ConnectTimeout failures — dangerous for a live demo,
since a failed call silently degraded to a near-meaningless hash-based
embedding and tanked confidence scores unpredictably.

Same model as before (multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, tuned for asymmetric
question -> passage retrieval), same 384-dim output — this is a
drop-in replacement, nothing downstream (chroma_client.py,
knowledge_agent.py) needs to change.
